# To Learn
## Theoretical
 - What the React Render Cycle looks like
  - Reconciliation? How keys fit in
 - JavaScript 
  - Statements vs Expressions double click and as relate to JSX
  - ARROW FUNCTION syntax! frontend threw a bug because of this. there is a nuance to return bracesand BLOCK BODIES
 - DOM events! And how React interacts with the DOM
  - Handlers as a concept 
 - Request / response cycles and middleware in expresss
 - Languages! Read a languages book ... 




## Practical
 - Use react state to augment blog posts on a page (div elements!)
 - Set up a server and tie that into the journal app scaffold
 - Iteratively creating elements using JSX 
 - Escaping to JSX and difference between {} and ()
 - How to program a node js server with endpoints and a database
 - Req and res object anatomies (fields, e.g. req.body)
 - The concept of mutation in javascript
 - state, immutability, controlled components, the render cycle, statements vs. expressions, and mutation

## Notes
Use this to note down every step of creating an app - super granularly, from imports to npm init, to editing package.json to middleware etc. - and memorize the process , be able to speak about it fluently and adapt it to new projects. Then create your own projects/problems , use an LLM as a crutch in the interim, but you should finally be able to code without the help of an LLM

 - endpoints are what clients use to call a route, whereas a route is defined on the server
 - if you don't hydrate a database you've configured, it'll reset every time you restart the app - defeating the purpose of a db
  - "configure and hydrate" more generally is a very common pattern

  git <command> [options/flags] [arguments] -> this is the style of git commands
    - git long flags are --set-upstream origin
    - git short flags are like -m after git commit
