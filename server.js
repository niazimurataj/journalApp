// we may first need an app - how do I use express to set up an app?
const app = express(); // always use the const keyword to declare a variable!

// this bit here is called middleware, and it lets the app understand JSON and CORS requests
app.use(cors()); // this allows the front end to talk to the backend by editing the headers so the browser doesn't freak out
app.use(express.json()); // this takes JSON formatted requests and turns them into JS objects so the request/response cycle can work properly

// # CONFIGURE THE DATABASE
// this just created the "handle" for the db , or the pointer - not hydrated/initialized yet 
// set up the database
const adapter = new JSONFile('db.json'); // this sets up the file that stores the data and abstracts the JSON // operations so we can use it like a database
const db = Low(adapter); // this is the db, it can read and write, and uses the adapter (which abstracts some JSON ops)


// # HYDRATE/INITIALIZE THE DATABASE

// initialize the db  (this is a common pattern - declare something, then initialize it ... declare then initialize :: wax on, wax off)
// you need to do the below intialization also because otherwise every time you restart the server, the db will be empty
await db.read(); // this reads the db file and loads it into memory
if (!db.data) {
    db.data = { entries: [] }; // this initializes the db with an empty array of entries if it doesn't exist
    // if you hadn't done the await before, this would mean that the db would be empty every time you restarted the server
    // which would be bad for a real app - it would defeat the purpose of having a database
}
