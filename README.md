# Simple Journal App
Goal: fight full stack skillset atrophy 

## What
A simple journaling app meant to jog the brain's web dev skillset.
 - You submit an entry into a form field
 - It gets stored as state
 - That state is passed into the body of a request
 - writing endpoint is fetched from an express backend
 - the info is pushed into a db
 - You can then list all entries from that db in a table

## Why
Unifies a few things, so I can remember how things work 
 - DOM interaction
 - React state
 - Endpoints
 - Databases
 - Express apps
 - basic HTML skills
 - basic JSX skills
 - some basic JS

I've basically been a strategist and my skillset atrophied for a while. 
Brings me joy to build, so why not? Hoping to do a few of these projects until I get my fluency back EOY
No vibe coding
